\section*{Work experience}
\subsection*{Jan 2020 - Present: Cambridge Quantum}
Software developer
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and constructed an authentication system backed by AWS Cognito that provided authentication in a microservices environment.
\item Wrote library to run compiler benchmarks in different Python virtual environments to compare package versions and find regressions.
Ran automated housekeeping tasks for updating and caching data and presented results and visualisations in a web app.
\item Constructed k8s ingress and load balancing for AWS EKS.\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Jan 2020 - Jan 2022: Lyryx Learning}
Senior software developer (11 months); Director of technology (13 months)
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed, developed and distributed a cross-platform mobile and web application to combine existing textbook content with new interactive questions. Used TypeScript, SQLite and Capacitor.
\item Created a local development environment for an existing Java web application. Used Docker, NGINX and Firejail to locally develop features that spanned multiple production servers.
\item Constructed a Web API for automatically scheduling examinations. Used Java Servlets and MySQL.

Data science fellow
\begin{itemize}
\item Collaborated with an industry partner to clean, explore and analyse 7 years of live events data stored in a PostgreSQL database with over 13 million entries.
\item Constructed a generalised linear model (GLM) for analysing count data and a log linear model for analysing sales data. Used Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks and the R programming language.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Sep 2017-Sep 2019: University of Calgary}
Postdoctoral scholar
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and completed projects in pure mathematics and computer science leading to a publication in a peer-reviewed journal and another paper under review.
\item Created a formal proof of a well-known result in category theory using the Coq proof assistant.
\item Provided mentoring support for two PhD students and reviewed two papers for mathematics journals.
\item Organised the University of Calgary Peripatetic Seminar (Dec 2017-May 2019) and chaired a session of the Alberta Mathematics Dialogue 2018.
